🌟 Excited to Share My Latest Project: Jarvis, the Personal Assistant! 🌟

Hello everyone,

I'm thrilled to introduce my new project, Jarvis – a voice-activated personal assistant that I developed using Python. Jarvis can perform various tasks such as fetching weather updates, opening popular applications like Visual Studio Code, Spotify, Gmail, WhatsApp, and even shutting down your PC upon command.

Here are some key features of Jarvis:

🌤 Weather Updates: Get real-time weather information for any city.
🕒 Time Queries: Ask for the current time.
🌐 Web Browsing: Open your default web browser with a simple voice command.
📄 File and Notepad Access: Open Notepad and File Explorer.
📧 Gmail Access: Open Gmail to check your emails.
🎵 Spotify Integration: Launch Spotify to enjoy your favorite music.
📱 WhatsApp and Instagram: Open WhatsApp and Instagram effortlessly.
🖥 Code Environment: Open Visual Studio Code for your coding needs.
🤖 ChatGPT and LeetCode: Access ChatGPT and LeetCode for AI chat and coding practice.
🔌 PC Shutdown: Shut down your PC with a voice command.
I used a combination of speech_recognition, pyttsx3, spacy, and several other Python libraries to bring Jarvis to life. Additionally, I've created an executable file using PyInstaller, making it easy to install and run Jarvis on any Windows PC.
